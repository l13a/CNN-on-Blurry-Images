# CNN-on-Blurry-Images

Due to the imperfection in sensory organs, data collected by the brain are inherently noisy. Similarly, noise is ubiquitous to training data and applications in machine learning. However, while the human brain makes use of noise to enhance signal processing, noise is generally frowned upon in machine learning, hence the plethora of denoising techniques and networks. Given the similarity of image categorization networks and human visual cortex, it is curious whether noise could potentially do more than just interfere with network performance. Here we investigate how image classification network can learn noise structure and shift its "focus" accordingly, using gradient visualization.
